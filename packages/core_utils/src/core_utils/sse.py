"""
Server-Sent Events (SSE) helpers for streaming short answers and final payloads.

These helpers live in the core_utils package so they can be shared across
services without introducing circular dependencies.  They implement the same
chunking semantics that the Gateway previously defined locally.

Two public generators are provided:

* ``stream_chunks`` streams tokenised chunks of a plain string and terminates
  with ``[DONE]``.  When ``include_event`` is ``True`` each token is preceded
  by ``event: short_answer`` and the terminating chunk is preceded by
  ``event: done``.

* ``stream_answer_with_final`` streams tokenised chunks of a short answer,
  then emits a final JSON payload before terminating with ``[DONE]``.  It
  accepts the same ``include_event`` flag and chunk size as ``stream_chunks``.

See the Gateway README for high level design and usage details.

    Args:
        text: The input string to chunk.  ``None`` is treated as ``""``.
        chunk_size: Desired length of each emitted chunk.  Values < 1

    Server‑Sent Events generator that streams a plain string one chunk at a time.

    It yields SSE lines conforming to the ``data:`` protocol.  Each chunk of the
    input text is wrapped in a small JSON object with a single ``token`` key.
    After all chunks have been sent the generator emits a terminal ``[DONE]``
    marker.  An optional ``event`` field is emitted before each data line to
    support client side event routing.

        text: The string to stream.  ``None`` is treated as ``""``.
        include_event: If set, prepend ``event: short_answer`` to each token

    Server‑Sent Events generator that streams a short answer followed by a final payload.

    This helper behaves like :func:`stream_chunks` for the short answer text, then
    emits the complete ``final_payload`` as a single SSE ``data:`` message before
    signalling completion with ``[DONE]``.  The ``include_event`` flag controls
    whether ``event:`` fields are emitted ahead of token and final messages.

        short_answer: The LLM‑produced short answer.  ``None`` is treated as ``""``.
        final_payload: A dict representing the full response to send after the
            short answer tokens.  It will be JSON‑encoded via ``jsonx.dumps``.
