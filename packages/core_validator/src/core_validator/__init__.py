"""
Public API for the core_validator package.

This module exposes the key validation entry points.  Consumers should
import functions from here rather than pulling private helpers from
``core_validator.validator`` directly.  The ``canonical_allowed_ids``
function computes a stable ordering of anchor, event and transition IDs
according to the Whyâ€‘Decision contract.
