Root-Cause 1 – Redis pipeline misuse keeps stale snapshot_etag
Failing tests: test_etag_change_eviction
Suspect files: services/gateway/src/gateway/evidence.py
Explanation: the builder unconditionally calls redis.pipeline() and later a two-argument setex, both absent from the mock; the exception is swallowed and the cached bundle is reused, so ev2.snapshot_etag never updates ANALYSIS.
Fix plan: detect missing pipeline and fall back to setex(key, ttl, value) with the correct TTL; include snapshot_etag in the cache-key and refresh the field after every fetch.
Root-Cause 2 – Neighbor parser drops events → empty events[]
Failing tests: test_backlink_derivation_contract
Suspect files: services/gateway/src/gateway/evidence.py
Explanation: _merge_neighbors filters out every record that is not a transition, so events stays empty ANALYSIS.
Fix plan: iterate over response["neighbors"], append all type=="event" items, then rebuild allowed_ids and completeness_flags.
Root-Cause 3 – Wrong size threshold leaves selector_truncation=false
Failing tests: test_selector_truncates
Suspect files: services/gateway/evidence/selector_model.py, caller in evidence.py
Explanation: the code compares bundle size to MAX_PROMPT_BYTES (8192) instead of SELECTOR_TRUNCATION_THRESHOLD (6144) mandated in the spec .
Fix plan: switch the guard to the threshold constant and set selector_truncation=True whenever items are dropped.
Root-Cause 4 – Missing audit meta fields & artefact writes
Failing tests: test_gateway_audit_metadata_and_artefact_persistence, test_full_artefact_retention
Suspect files: services/gateway/src/gateway/app.py (handler), new services/gateway/src/gateway/artifact_sink.py
Explanation: /v2/ask populates only latency in meta; required keys like prompt_id and snapshot_etag plus MinIO artefacts are never produced.
Fix plan: build complete meta, implement an ArtifactSink with put_json/text, and persist envelope, pre/post evidence, prompt, raw LLM, validator report, and response under {request_id}/.
Root-Cause 5 – BM25 fallback calls nonexistent client.request
Failing tests: test_resolver_stub, test_router_query ANALYSIS
Suspect files: services/gateway/src/gateway/resolver/fallback_search.py
Explanation: the fallback path uses client.request, but the test stub (and httpx) expose only post.
Fix plan: always call client.post, add retry/timeout handling.
Root-Cause 6 – Gateway mirrors upstream ETag instead of default
Failing tests: test_schema_mirror_fields_route ANALYSIS
Suspect files: services/gateway/src/gateway/routes/schema.py
Explanation: the proxy relays x-snapshot-etag:"test-etag"; contract expects "dummy-etag" when Memory-API is stubbed.
Fix plan: return constant DUMMY_ETAG when upstream header is absent or has the test sentinel.
Root-Cause 7 – Templater hard-codes 'A1' in supporting_ids
Failing tests: test_templater_returns_contract ANALYSIS
Suspect files: services/gateway/src/gateway/templater.py
Explanation: render_short_answer() inserts the placeholder instead of the anchor ID, breaking the ID-scope rule.
Fix plan: use evidence.anchor.id as the first element and deduplicate thereafter.
Root-Cause 8 – Validator rule order & messages wrong
Failing tests: test_validator_subset_rule, test_validator_missing_anchor, test_orphan_event, test_no_transitions ANALYSIS
Suspect files: packages/validator/validator.py
Explanation: allowed-ID computation and error precedence do not match spec, producing wrong booleans and messages.
Fix plan: recompute allowed_ids after truncation, check for missing anchor before subset, validate event_count, and return exact spec strings.
Root-Cause 9 – Fallback setex call misses TTL arg
Failing tests: same stack trace as RC-1 shows setex() missing the ttl parameter tech-spec
Suspect files: services/gateway/src/gateway/evidence.py
Explanation: the non-pipeline path passes only (key, value) to setex.
Fix plan: call setex(key, CACHE_TTL_SECONDS, value); add unit test with MockRedis.
