Are we “effectively testing Stage‑2”?
After applying the patch above and adding these tests:

k=1 expand: covered by unit and contract tests (already present).

Resolver pipeline: now covered for slug short‑circuit, BM25/vector flag pass‑through, and timeout semantics.

Headers / ETag propagation: exercised on Memory API schema endpoints.

Health/ready: covered with a stubbed ready check.

Still out of scope for Stage‑2 tests (acceptable for now):

Actual BM25 ranking correctness (requires ArangoSearch fixtures).

Actual vector index path (requires Arango with vector index enabled).

Redis caching semantics (Milestone 2 mentions optional caching; tests can be added once a cache layer is wired).

Anything missing we should add later?
Gateway “slug skip” test: when a slug is provided to /v2/ask, the gateway should avoid resolver calls and go straight to expand/enrich, per the spec. Add once the resolver module lands in gateway. 

Enrich endpoints contract tests (/api/enrich/{decision|event|transition}/{id}) asserting normalized shapes and 404 behavior; trivial to add by monkeypatching store()—use the same pattern as above.

Selector timeouts and budgets (Milestone 3), not required for Stage‑2, but worth planning.
