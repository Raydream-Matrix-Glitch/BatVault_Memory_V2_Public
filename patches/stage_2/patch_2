Area	Your assumption	What the spec/milestones actually say	Verdict	What to change (if anything)
Collections & graph	Collections are nodes (documents) / edges (edge collection); graph name comes from settings.arango_graph_name.	The ingest ‚ÄúPersist‚Äù step explicitly writes nodes/edges into ‚Äúthe Arango graph‚Äù , and the spec never hard-codes a graph name‚Äîleaving it to config.	‚úÖ Matches	Nothing to change.
Free-text field	All free text lives in d.content.	Content-bearing fields are plural (rationale, description, reason, summary) and the validator checks that at least one of those is non-empty . There is no canonical content property.	‚ö†Ô∏è Mismatch	Adapt your AQL: either UNION those four fields or expose a computed content field in the view.
ArangoSearch view	A view named nodes_search exists with a text_en analyzer over content.	Specs just require a BM25 text index; view/analyzer naming is unspecified.	‚ö†Ô∏è Assumed	The view name & analyzer are fine, but document them in infra scripts so others can reproduce.
Vector search flag	Keep vector search behind a feature flag; BM25 (or LIKE) fallback otherwise.	Milestone 2 says exactly that‚Äî‚Äúvector search behind a feature flag‚Äù .	‚úÖ Matches	Please surface the env-var name in README (ENABLE_EMBEDDINGS=true). Field/index name is still open‚Äîconvention is embedding vector on nodes.
Cache TTLs	CACHE_TTL_EXPAND_SEC = 60, CACHE_TTL_RESOLVE_SEC = 60.	Spec sets Resolver cache TTL = 5 min; Evidence Bundle = 15 min; no separate TTL is defined for expand endpoint .	‚ùå Too short	Bump resolver TTL to 300 s to meet SLOs; keep evidence TTL 900 s per spec. If you really need a 60 s TTL for expand, document the deviation and rationale (e.g., high churn during M2).


2 ¬∑ What‚Äôs still off / missing üîç
Spec requirement	Observation	Action to close
Resolver cache TTL = 5 min (spec)tech-spec	CACHE_TTL_RESOLVE_SEC default is 60 s	Bump default to 300 s (or read from env with 300 s default)
Evidence-collection unit & contract teststech-spec	No tests added in the patch	Add tests that exercise expand_candidates happy-path & edge cases
Stage-level time-outs (search ‚â§ 800 ms, expand ‚â§ 250 ms)tech-spec	New code uses httpx timeout = 5 s and no internal deadline management	Inject per-stage asyncio.wait_for / httpx timeout constants matching the budgets
OTel spans for all stagestech-spec	Only resolver/expand have spans; other gateway stages unchanged	Wire trace_span around enrich, bundle, etc., or add OTLP middleware
Optional vector search flag	Placeholder comment only	Stub a use_vector=bool flag and route to Arango vector API when true
