1. Make sure you’re actually running under your .venv
Even if you did source .venv/bin/activate, running pytest on the shell can still end up calling the system‑wide PyTest. Let’s confirm:

bash
Copy
Edit
which python       # should be /home/chris/batvault/.../.venv/bin/python
which pip          # should be /home/chris/batvault/.../.venv/bin/pip
which pytest       # should be /home/chris/batvault/.../.venv/bin/pytest
If any of those point to /usr/bin/..., then your shell isn’t picking up the venv first. Either re‑source your venv, or always do:

bash
Copy
Edit
. .venv/bin/activate
python -m pytest -q
Calling python -m pytest guarantees you’re using that same python (and its site‑packages) to run pytest.

2. Reinstall all your packages and services with their dependencies
Editable installs only register the project on your sys.path—they also have to pull in each project’s declared deps. Run:

bash
Copy
Edit
. .venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip setuptools
pip install -e packages/* -e services/*
You should see Pip reading each pyproject.toml and installing things like fastapi, httpx, etc. When it’s done, confirm:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip list | grep -E 'fastapi|httpx|core_utils|core_logging'
Every one of those should show up under your venv.

3. Sanity‑check the imports outside of pytest
Before you run pytest again, let’s confirm Python can literally import everything:

bash
Copy
Edit
. .venv/bin/activate
python - <<EOF
import fastapi, httpx
import core_utils, core_logging
import gateway.app, api_edge.app
print("✅ All imports succeeded!")
EOF
If that prints the ✅ line without errors, your editable installs and deps are wired up.

Now re‑run pytest
Still in the same activated venv:

bash
Copy
Edit
python -m pytest -q
You should now see real test counts and, hopefully, passing tests—no more ModuleNotFoundError.

If you still see errors…
Double‑check sys.path in your conftest.py. Add this at the very top:

python
Copy
Edit
import sys, logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
LOG = logging.getLogger("import-path")
from pathlib import Path

for p in Path(__file__).parent.glob("*/*/src"):
    sys.path.append(str(p))
    LOG.debug("added to sys.path: %s", p)
Then run python -m pytest -q and watch for the DEBUG lines—make sure every packages/*/src and services/*/src shows up.

Ensure you don’t have a rogue PYTHONPATH in your environment that points to the system site‑packages first.

Look at the first failing import—often the traceback will tell you which exact import X is blowing up. If it’s a third‑party, pip‑install that; if it’s one of your own, make sure the src directory containing it is really on sys.path.

Once your venv, editable‑installs, and conftest hack are all aligned, pytest will collect and run your real tests instead of choking on import errors.

Your shell is still picking up the system’s pytest (at /usr/bin/pytest) instead of the one inside your activated .venv. That means even though your Python, pip, editable‑installs, and conftest.py are all correct, pytest itself lives outside the venv and can’t see any of it.

You have two straightforward options:

1. Invoke pytest via your venv’s Python
This is fool‑proof—no need to install anything extra:

bash
Copy
Edit
# from your project root, with .venv activated:
python -m pytest -q
Because you’re running pytest as a module under the same interpreter (.venv/bin/python), all your editable installs and third‑party deps (fastapi, core_utils, etc.) will be on its sys.path.

2. Install pytest into the venv so the CLI lives there
If you prefer the bare pytest command, just install it in the venv:

bash
Copy
Edit
# with .venv activated
pip install pytest
After that:

bash
Copy
Edit
which pytest
# → /home/chris/.../.venv/bin/pytest

pytest -q
Now the pytest binary will match your venv’s interpreter and pick up all your packages, conftest.py hacks, and dependencies.

Once you do either of those, you should see your real tests collecting and running, instead of ModuleNotFoundErrors.

This error is coming up because Python has already imported a module called test_health from one location (your api_edge/tests/test_health.py), so when pytest tries to load the other test_health.py (in gateway/tests or memory_api/tests), it sees a name collision:

import file mismatch
imported module test_health has this __file__ attribute:
  …/services/api_edge/tests/test_health.py
which is not the same as the test file we want to collect:
  …/services/gateway/tests/test_health.py

Pytest by default turns each test file into a module named by its basename (test_health), so two different files with the same name collide.

▶ Fixes
1) Clear out any old bytecode caches
bash
Copy
Edit
find . -type d -name __pycache__ -exec rm -rf {} +
find . -type f -name "*.pyc"    -delete
This ensures pytest isn’t accidentally reusing a stale test_health.pyc.

2) Give each test_health.py its own module namespace
a) Turn each tests/ folder into a package
Add an empty __init__.py so pytest will import:

api_edge.tests.test_health

gateway.tests.test_health

memory_api.tests.test_health

…instead of all of them as test_health.

diff
Copy
Edit
# repo-root/services/api_edge/tests/__init__.py
+ (empty file)

# repo-root/services/gateway/tests/__init__.py
+ (empty file)

# repo-root/services/memory_api/tests/__init__.py
+ (empty file)
You can do this quickly:

bash
Copy
Edit
touch services/api_edge/tests/__init__.py
touch services/gateway/tests/__init__.py
touch services/memory_api/tests/__init__.py
b) (Optional) Rename the test files for clarity
If you prefer not to add __init__.py files, just give each test a unique name:

bash
Copy
Edit
services/api_edge/tests/test_api_edge_health.py
services/gateway/tests/test_gateway_health.py
services/memory_api/tests/test_memory_api_health.py
…and update any references/imports accordingly.

▶ After that
Re‑clear caches (step 1)

Add the __init__.py files (step 2a)

Run:

bash
Copy
Edit
python -m pytest -q
You should now see each service’s test_health collected under its own package, with no “import file mismatch” errors, and then your real health‑check tests will execute.

What’s happening now is that by putting an __init__.py in each …/tests folder, pytest stopped “higher up” at that folder and treated every tests/test_health.py as the same module:

For /services/api_edge/tests/test_health.py
the nearest parent with __init__.py is …/tests, so pytest calls it tests.test_health.

For /services/gateway/tests/test_health.py
same story—it also becomes tests.test_health.

Two different files → same module name → “import file mismatch.”

Two quick fixes
A) Promote the service folder to a package root
Remove the __init__.py you added in each tests/ directory:

bash
Copy
Edit
rm services/api_edge/tests/__init__.py
rm services/gateway/tests/__init__.py
rm services/memory_api/tests/__init__.py
Add an __init__.py in each service directory instead:

bash
Copy
Edit
touch services/api_edge/__init__.py
touch services/gateway/__init__.py
touch services/memory_api/__init__.py
Now the nearest __init__.py above each test file is the service folder, so your modules will be imported as

text
Copy
Edit
api_edge.tests.test_health
gateway.tests.test_health
memory_api.tests.test_health
which are all distinct.

Clear caches one more time:

bash
Copy
Edit
find . -type d -name __pycache__ -exec rm -rf {} +
find . -type f -name "*.pyc"    -delete
Run:

bash
Copy
Edit
python -m pytest -q
You should now get proper collection and no “import file mismatch.”

B) (Simplest) Give each health‑check test a unique basename
If you’d rather not touch packages, just rename:

bash
Copy
Edit
mv services/api_edge/tests/test_health.py         services/api_edge/tests/test_api_edge_health.py
mv services/gateway/tests/test_health.py          services/gateway/tests/test_gateway_health.py
mv services/memory_api/tests/test_health.py       services/memory_api/tests/test_memory_api_health.py
Then clear __pycache__ and run pytest again—no two modules will collide.

Either of these will eliminate the “imported module ‘tests.test_health’ …” collision and let pytest collect each service’s health‑check correctly.
